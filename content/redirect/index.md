## Adding Redirects for old content

This is done by adding the old URL (the one you want to redirect) as an alias to the new destination page.

##### Example:
```
date: 2016-09-13T09:00:00+00:00
title: Artifacts
menu:
    main:
        parent: "Using Vamp"
        weight: 10
aliases:
    - /using-vamp/
```
